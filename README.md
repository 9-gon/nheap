# nheap
### version 0.0.1

nheap is an extension library for the heaps.io framework  
this is by no means an exhaustive list of features or a game engine in and of itself - it's designed simply as a collection of utilities that i personally use between projects  
feel free to fork and extend this all you like, although i probably won't accept any pr's (nothing personal - i just want to be the only one to break my code)
